# GameDev
I just added a couple of little projects created by me. Mainly this is just a small games which I have created by myself. 


Steps to open a game:
1) Download RAR file
2) Extract into comfortable place
3) Open "MyRunner1.exe" file
4) Enjoy!


*This is just a raw game, base to create bigger one and to improve it. So don't blame meðŸ¤”*
